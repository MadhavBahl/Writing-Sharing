# Think Incognito
Any website can identify and track you, even if you are using Private Browsing or Incognito Mode in your web browser. Many people think that they can hide their identity if they are using private browsing or incognito. 
This article is going to prove them all wrong.

Look at some memes :)

### How were they related to this article?
I will be answering to all your questions shortly.

First, go visit this website: <a href="https://think-incognito.herokuapp.com/">Think Incognito</a>
  * Enter your **NAME** there.
  * Close that window.
  * Open *Private browsing* or *Incognito Mode*.
  * Again visit the same website
SURPRIZED????
Yes, the website can remember your name even if you had visited it via the Private browsing or Incognito Mode. Yes, nothing is private in this world anymore!. This is what the big companies are doing with your identity. You think that going into private mode will wipe out all the traces?. Absolutely Not! Actually, using the private browsing or incognito mode will just help you to clear your browsing history. Your internet service providers, search engines and your favorite websites can still track you. They can know you. They know what you like and dislike. They use your data to earn money.

#### How ThinkIncognito was made?
THINK INCOGNITO uses the browser fingerprinting feature of Client.js to obtain the fingerprint of your web browser.
When you submit your name, your name( an instance of data) gets stored with your digital fingerprint as the key.
Whenever you open up the website next time, first it goes through all those keys, to check whether the information regarding your browser already exists or not, if yes, then that is displayed.
