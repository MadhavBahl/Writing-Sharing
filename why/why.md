# Why I started to write and why all of you shoul also write?

## 1. You can not always speak to share thoughts
Many a times it happens that you want to express your thoughts, put out your feelings, share your experiences, teach others what you have been learning lately, nut rarely you get chance to do so, rarely you get chance for public speaking (unless you are at some good position).
The best thing you can do at that moment is to write down your thoughts, and the next step, publish them to social networking so that people can view and learn from them.

## 2. I Want to teach
Since i am a web developer myself, i know what al problems a person face when he starts to code and all the problems faced by a newbie.
I want to teach all begginners so that they dont have to waste time among those problems which i faced.

## 3. Importance of engish as a global language
Improving the ability to express yourself in good english phrases is a necessity.

## 4. Writing on PC - Typing
It is fun to type :)
